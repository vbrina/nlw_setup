# nlw_setup

This project has been created during the NLW by Rocketseat.

Inside <code>server</code> you can see the code related to the backend, which is using Node with Prisma as an ORM.

Inside <code>web</code> you can see the code related to the frontend, which is built in Vite + React together with Radix for fully accessible components
and TailwindCSS for styling.

Note: both projects are using TypeScript.

To run any of the projects, you'll need to:

Run: <code>npm install</code> to install all its dependencies.

And then: <code>npm run dev</code> to run both projects locally.
